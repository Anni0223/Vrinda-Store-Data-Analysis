
DATA CLEANING

1. Applying a filter and checking in each columns the values that filter displays , we check for null values like this, but it only shows first 10000 values 
so we need a better effective technique.
2. The gender column contain M, Men , W , Women. I did find and replace M to men but the m in women was also converted to men funny Womenen. The solution 
was to apply a filter for M and then replace these M to Men , the filtered out columns were not affected . Did the Same for Women.

DATA PROCESSING 

1. Created a new column for age groups 
2. Paste this new column as value because if it is there as a formula the woeksheet is a little slow.
3. Extracted month from the date columns
NOTE:: These steps are done keeping in mind the dasboard / analysis we will require , for example we know we will need month.

DATA ANALYSIS

1. Created a pivot table for the orders count and sales amount and then created a chart , in the chart axis formated the sales amount using::::
   Number --> Custom --> 0.00,,"M"  and the scale was converted to million  (14.30 min in the video)
NOTE:: A pivot chart can be refreshed and all the data will be updated.

2. Use data callout option in data lables to display percentage in pie chart.

3. We can filter top values in a pivot table easily

4. Age and Gender Sheet :: Age Group in rows , gender in columns , and order id for the count in values, then show 
values as percentage of total.
